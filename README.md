# Slicing game

An open source project developing a mix of mobile app and game in a framework which stores the app structure in several JSON pages.


## The JSON framework

The app will be built with components and modules which can be inflated from JSON. Together they form JSON pages for building screens. These pages can be shared between iOS and Android when unifying the component properties and layout system.
